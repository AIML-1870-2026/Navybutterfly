# Assignment 0 Specification

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Hello World - NavyButterfly  
**Purpose:** Set up development environment and verify GitHub Pages deployment workflow  
**Author:** NavyButterfly  
**Date:** January 27, 2025

## Project Goals
The goal of this assignment is to:
1. Set up all necessary development tools (Homebrew, GitHub CLI, git)
2. Create a GitHub repository
3. Build a simple HTML page
4. Deploy the page to GitHub Pages
5. Verify the complete workflow from code to live website

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Display a simple greeting message: "Hello from NavyButterfly!"
- Page must be accessible via a public URL
- HTML must be valid and well-formed

### Technical Requirements
- Single HTML file (`index.html`)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Repository: `NavyButterfly`
- Live URL: `https://kberan4137.github.io/NavyButterfly/`

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- Install Homebrew (package manager for Mac)
- Install GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Authenticate with GitHub account

### Step 2: Repository Creation
- Create public repository named "NavyButterfly"
- Clone repository to local machine
- Configure git user settings

### Step 3: Page Development
- Create `index.html` with basic HTML structure
- Add greeting message and basic content
- Test locally to ensure it displays correctly

### Step 4: Deployment
- Stage changes with `git add`
- Commit changes with descriptive message
- Push to GitHub repository
- Enable GitHub Pages with Static HTML workflow
- Verify deployment in Actions tab

### Step 5: Verification
- Visit live URL to confirm page is accessible
- Verify content displays as expected
- Submit repository URL for grading

## Expected Outcome
A functioning "Hello World" webpage accessible at `https://kberan4137.github.io/NavyButterfly/` that demonstrates:
- Successful tool installation and configuration
- Understanding of git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Ability to deploy to GitHub Pages
- Complete development environment ready for future assignments

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All development tools installed and working
- ✅ GitHub repository created and accessible
- ✅ HTML page displays greeting message
- ✅ Page is live and accessible via GitHub Pages URL
- ✅ Git workflow (add, commit, push) completed successfully

## Lessons Learned
