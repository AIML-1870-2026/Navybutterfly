# RGB Color Studio

**AIML 1870 — Assignment 08**

A playful, interactive RGB Color Studio built around a **paint mixing metaphor** — but with a twist. While the interface looks and feels like mixing paint on a cartoon artist's palette, the underlying math is *additive RGB light mixing*.

## Features

- **Paint Mixer Explorer** — draggable paint blobs on an SVG palette, bidirectionally linked RGB sliders, blob size/opacity animated by value
- **Color Theory Coach** — live hue/saturation/lightness explanations with a mini color wheel indicator
- **Palette Generator** — 5 harmony types (Complementary, Analogous, Triadic, Split-Complementary, Tetradic)
- **Contrast Checker** — WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA badges for every color pair
- **Color Blindness Simulator** — Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia via LMS matrix transforms
- Click-to-copy hex codes, randomize button, animated teaching callout
