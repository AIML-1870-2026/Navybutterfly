## A Research Report on Artificial Intelligence's Impact on Medicine

---

## 1. My Field and Career Goals

I'm pursuing a career in medicine with the goal of becoming a surgeon. Surgery appeals to me because it combines technical skill, critical decision-making, and direct patient impact in ways that few other fields can match. The ability to intervene decisively in life-threatening situations and to see immediate, tangible results from your work is what draws me to this demanding profession. While I haven't yet decided on a specific surgical specialty, I'm exploring the field broadly to understand where my skills and interests align best.

## 2. AI's Current Presence in Surgery

AI is already deeply embedded in surgical practice across multiple dimensions, transforming how surgeons plan, perform, and assess procedures. The integration isn't coming—it's already here.

### Surgical Robotics

The most visible manifestation of AI in surgery is robotic-assisted surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, dominates this space with over 10,670 systems installed in hospitals worldwide as of 2025. In 2024 alone, more than 2,680,000 procedures were performed on da Vinci systems, representing an 18% increase from the previous year. The global surgical robotics market was valued at approximately $11 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $30 billion by 2031.

These aren't simple tools—they're sophisticated platforms that enhance surgical precision dramatically. Recent studies show that AI-assisted robotic surgeries demonstrated a 25% reduction in operative time and a 30% decrease in intraoperative complications compared to manual methods. Surgical precision improved by 40%, and patient recovery times shortened by an average of 15%.

The technology is advancing rapidly beyond basic robotic assistance. In 2025, researchers at Johns Hopkins University demonstrated a surgical robot that performed intestinal surgery autonomously on pig tissue, making real-time decisions and self-correcting when things didn't go as expected. This system uses the same machine learning architecture that powers ChatGPT and can respond to spoken commands during procedures.

### Operating Room Intelligence

AI has moved beyond the robot itself into the broader operating room environment. Tampa General Hospital deployed AI-powered surgical operations systems in 28 of its 52 operating rooms in 2024. These systems use cameras and sensors to monitor procedures in real-time, track surgical instruments, identify anatomical structures, and even predict surgical duration by learning individual surgeons' patterns and typical operating times.

AI systems can now recognize surgical phases with 81-93% accuracy and identify anatomical structures with 71-98% accuracy during procedures. This real-time awareness allows for better scheduling, resource allocation, and safety monitoring.

### Preoperative Planning and Risk Assessment

Surgeons are using AI extensively for preoperative risk stratification and surgical planning. Machine learning algorithms analyze patient databases containing millions of procedures to predict individual patient risks, potential complications, and optimal surgical approaches. The technology can process combinations of structured and unstructured data—including electronic medical records, imaging, laboratory values, and vital signs—to generate clinical decision support that would be impossible for human surgeons to synthesize manually.

AI has proven particularly powerful in medical imaging. In computer vision applications for surgery, AI helps with tumor detection, anatomical mapping, and surgical navigation. Studies show that AI assistance has reduced the error rate in detecting cancer-positive lymph nodes from 3.4% to 0.5%.

### Training and Education

AI is revolutionizing how future surgeons learn. Mount Sinai researchers developed an AI-driven surgical education model using extended-reality headsets and deep learning algorithms that successfully taught 17 trainees to perform partial nephrectomy procedures without an instructor present. The system monitors training through first-person cameras and provides real-time feedback and corrective prompts.

Recent research published in 2025 found that combining AI feedback with expert instruction led to significantly greater performance improvements than expert instruction alone. Notably, AI feedback showed no diminishing returns, while human expert feedback did—suggesting AI can provide unlimited, consistent training capacity.

Multiple institutions are now deploying VR simulation combined with machine learning to create fully immersive training experiences with unbiased personalized feedback. Studies show that residents completing VR-enhanced training programs achieve competency milestones 30% faster than those in traditional programs.

## 3. The Opportunities

AI creates several transformative opportunities for surgeons and patients alike.

### Enhanced Surgical Precision and Safety

The fundamental promise of AI in surgery is better outcomes. The 30% reduction in intraoperative complications and 40% improvement in surgical precision documented in recent studies translate directly into lives saved and suffering prevented. For patients, this means smaller incisions, less blood loss, reduced pain, fewer complications, and faster recovery. For surgeons, it means enhanced capabilities to tackle increasingly complex cases.

AI systems can now anticipate the next 15-30 seconds of an operation based on analysis of millions of surgical videos, potentially allowing surgeons to change course before complications develop. Some hospitals are implementing AI overlays on surgical video screens during laparoscopic procedures to suggest safer operating zones in real-time.

### Democratization of Surgical Expertise

One of the most profound opportunities is making expert-level surgery more accessible. Currently, surgical outcomes vary significantly based on surgeon experience and institutional resources. AI has the potential to elevate baseline surgical quality everywhere by providing decision support, technical guidance, and real-time feedback even in settings without access to top-tier surgical expertise.

The development of autonomous surgical capabilities—while still requiring surgeon supervision—could help address the global shortage of trained surgeons. As one expert noted, the goal is not to replace human expertise but to boost it, making expert-level surgery accessible to everyone while alleviating surgeon shortages.

### New Surgical Specializations

AI is creating entirely new roles and specializations within surgery. Surgeons who can effectively integrate AI tools, interpret algorithmic recommendations, and lead AI implementation in surgical departments will be highly valued. There's growing demand for surgeon-scientists who understand both medicine and data science, who can develop and validate new AI applications, and who can bridge the gap between technological capability and clinical need.

The field of surgical informatics—using data and AI to improve surgical care—is rapidly expanding. Surgeons with expertise in this area will shape how AI is deployed, ensuring it enhances rather than undermines surgical practice.

### Revolutionized Training

For aspiring surgeons, AI offers unprecedented learning opportunities. Instead of waiting for specific cases to come through the operating room, trainees can practice unlimited variations of procedures in VR environments with AI coaching. The technology can identify specific weaknesses in technique and provide targeted feedback in ways that overwhelmed attending surgeons cannot.

AI assessment systems promise objective, automated, reproducible surgical performance evaluation that is free from rater bias. This could make surgical education more equitable and efficient, accelerating the development of expertise.

### Cognitive Augmentation

Unlike previous surgical innovations that enhanced perception (microscopes, fluorescence, ultrasound), AI augments cognition. By analyzing enormous databases, AI offers insights that transform the operative environment—enabling better preoperative risk assessment, more informed candidate selection for procedures, increased operating room efficiency, and improved coordination of critical resources.

This cognitive partnership could allow surgeons to focus on higher-level judgment, patient communication, and the irreducibly human aspects of care while offloading certain analytical and pattern-recognition tasks to AI systems.

## 4. The Challenges

Despite its promise, AI integration into surgery presents significant challenges and risks that must be taken seriously.

### The Deskilling Risk

Perhaps the greatest concern is that reliance on AI could diminish fundamental surgical skills. If surgeons become dependent on algorithmic recommendations and robotic precision, they may lose the manual dexterity, improvisational ability, and judgment that come from extensive hands-on experience. As one analysis warned, over-reliance risks diminishing surgeons' skills, increasing surgical errors, and undermining their decision-making autonomy.

This is particularly concerning for surgical training. If residents learn primarily through AI-assisted systems, will they be able to function effectively when systems fail, in emergency situations, or in resource-limited settings without advanced technology? The aviation industry has grappled with similar concerns about pilots who trained extensively on autopilot systems struggling to manually fly aircraft in emergencies.

### The Black Box Problem

Many AI systems operate as "black boxes"—they make recommendations or predictions without transparent explanations of their reasoning. Surgeons may feel pressured to follow AI-driven recommendations without fully understanding the underlying logic. This creates ethical dilemmas: Who is responsible when an AI-influenced decision leads to poor outcomes? How can surgeons maintain professional autonomy when algorithms are providing guidance they cannot fully interrogate?

Current AI systems, while highly capable, cannot exercise judgment or adaptability similar to human surgeons, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. They lack the nuanced decision-making skills that come with experience and cannot effectively handle dynamically unstructured information.

### Bias and Inequality

AI systems are only as good as the data used to train them. If training datasets inadequately represent diverse patient populations, AI biases can result in misdiagnoses and worsen healthcare disparities. Algorithms trained primarily on data from well-resourced institutions or certain demographic groups may perform poorly for others.

There's also concern about access inequality. The da Vinci systems cost $1.5-2 million plus ongoing maintenance and training expenses. If AI-enhanced surgery becomes the standard of care, patients at institutions that cannot afford these systems may receive inferior treatment, potentially creating a two-tiered healthcare system.

### Changing Nature of Surgical Expertise

AI fundamentally challenges what it means to be an expert surgeon. Traditionally, expertise came from accumulated experience, pattern recognition developed over thousands of cases, and hard-won technical skill. But if AI can recognize patterns better by analyzing millions of procedures, and if robotic systems provide superior precision, what distinctly human skills remain essential?

This shift raises uncomfortable questions. As competency frameworks evolve, surgeons may find their value increasingly measured not by their independent capabilities but by their ability to effectively collaborate with AI systems. This represents a profound identity shift for a profession built on individual mastery and autonomy.

### Implementation Challenges

Beyond philosophical concerns, there are practical barriers. Integration of AI requires high-quality datasets, which many hospitals lack. Transitioning AI systems from simulated environments to actual surgeries raises safety concerns. Regulatory frameworks are still developing, creating uncertainty about liability, validation standards, and appropriate use cases.

There's also the challenge of training surgeons—particularly those already in practice—to effectively use AI tools. Many surgeons completed their training before these technologies existed and may struggle to adapt. This creates generational tensions and raises questions about continuing competency requirements.

### Economic and Professional Disruption

The surgical robotics market's explosive growth is driven by commercial interests that may not align perfectly with patient care. There's risk that economic pressures could push adoption of AI before it's fully validated, or that certain procedures become exclusively robotic not because outcomes are better but because hospitals want to justify expensive equipment purchases.

Some projections suggest that certain routine surgical tasks—suturing, knot-tying, closing port sites—will be automated by AI-controlled robots. While this may improve efficiency, it also means entry-level surgical tasks that residents historically learned on may disappear, fundamentally changing the training pathway.

## 5. My Response: Personal Strategy for Thriving Alongside AI

Given this research, I'm developing a deliberate strategy to position myself for success in an AI-augmented surgical future.

### Embrace the Technology Early

Rather than viewing AI as a threat, I'm choosing to see it as a powerful set of tools I need to master. I will seek out opportunities during medical school and residency to work with AI systems, surgical robots, and simulation technologies. Early familiarity will give me a competitive advantage and help me understand both capabilities and limitations firsthand.

### Develop Complementary Skills

I'm focusing on skills that AI cannot easily replicate. This includes:

**Judgment in ambiguous situations**: AI excels with structured problems but struggles with genuinely novel scenarios. Cultivating comfort with uncertainty and developing sound clinical judgment will remain essential.

**Communication and empathy**: Patient interactions, family conversations about surgical risks, and ethical decision-making are fundamentally human. I'll prioritize developing these skills alongside technical abilities.

**Critical evaluation**: Rather than blindly trusting AI recommendations, I'll learn to critically evaluate algorithmic outputs, understand when they're likely to be reliable, and recognize when human judgment should override AI suggestions.

**Leadership and implementation**: By understanding both medicine and technology, I can position myself to lead AI integration efforts, ensuring they serve patients and clinicians rather than just institutional or commercial interests.

### Pursue Dual Expertise

I'm seriously considering pursuing additional training in data science, biomedical informatics, or surgical innovation alongside traditional surgical training. Surgeon-scientists who understand both clinical medicine and AI will be extraordinarily valuable in shaping how these technologies evolve. This might mean taking research years during residency or pursuing formal education in adjacent fields.

### Stay Adaptable

The field is changing rapidly—what's cutting-edge today may be standard tomorrow. I'm committed to continuous learning and staying current with technological developments. This means maintaining intellectual humility, acknowledging that my training will need updating throughout my career, and staying connected to surgical education and research communities.

### Advocate Thoughtfully

Surgeons must be at the table as AI is integrated into medicine. I plan to engage with professional organizations, contribute to discussions about best practices and standards, and advocate for responsible AI implementation that prioritizes patient safety and maintains the profession's core values. We cannot allow external forces—regulators, administrators, or technology companies—to dictate how AI is used in surgery without surgeon input.

## 6. Reflection

What surprised me most was how quickly and completely AI has already penetrated surgical practice. I expected to find emerging technologies and experimental applications. Instead, I discovered that AI is already performing or assisting with millions of procedures annually, that it's become integral to operating room management, and that it's fundamentally reshaping surgical education.

The sophistication of current systems shocked me—robots that can perform autonomous surgery, AI that can predict the next 30 seconds of an operation, systems that can teach surgical skills as effectively as expert surgeons. These aren't distant possibilities; they're present realities.

This research completely changed my perspective on AI's relevance to my career. Before this assignment, I vaguely understood that AI was "important" but saw it as something I could address later in my career. Now I recognize that AI integration is happening during the years I'll be training, and that the surgical landscape when I finish residency will be fundamentally different from today's.

The research also shifted my view from seeing AI primarily as a threat (to jobs, autonomy, or traditional surgical skill) to seeing it as a tool that, if properly understood and deployed, could make me a better surgeon and improve outcomes for my future patients. The key insight is that AI works best not as a replacement for surgeons but as a cognitive and technical partner.

However, the concerns about deskilling, black-box decision-making, and inequitable access are real and serious. These aren't problems that will resolve themselves through technological progress. They require active engagement from surgeons—including future surgeons like me—to ensure AI enhances rather than undermines the profession and patient care.

Perhaps most importantly, this assignment taught me that ignoring AI isn't an option. The students who will thrive are those who engage early, develop complementary skills, and help shape how these technologies are implemented. The assignment's opening warning was right: five years from now, I'll either be someone who understood early how AI would reshape surgery and prepared accordingly, or I'll be frantically trying to catch up.

I choose the former.
